# Godot OCIF: Open Canvas Interchange Format

Godot implementation of OCIF, the Open Canvas Interchange Format https://github.com/ocwg/spec

**Note:** The OCIF Format is still a work in progress and is not yet ratified by the Open Canvas Working Group. Until OCIF is finalized, this addon should be considered experimental and subject to change at any time to comply with the latest iteration of the draft specification.

For full functionality, this addon requires Godot 4.4 or later with [this PR](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/94603). It can be used with Godot 4.3, but the export settings will not be available.

The addon is licensed under The Unlicense. Anyone is free to use this without restriction. Credit is appreciated but not required.
